Presidents
==========

List of Presidents with their images and short bio. This is created as an example to show the usage of the list view with loading the images from resources.

To look into the code open the following link
https://github.com/naveentammineni/Presidents/tree/master/app/src/main/java/naveent/com/presidents

I have used the Universal Image loader jar file to load the images smooth. This is a third party open source library, can be found at https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader.

Images and the strings that are displayed are stored in the drawable folders and can be added going futher without changing the code.
